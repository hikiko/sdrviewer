Simple pixel shader viewer
==========================

Build:
------
make

Usage:
------
./sdrviewer \<shader filename\>

Pressing b enables and disables the busy loop (useful to count the
framerate).
Pressing - and = (the -/+ buttons) decreases and increases the camera
sensitivity.

NOTE: if you are editing files using Vim you might need to do:
:set nowritebackup
