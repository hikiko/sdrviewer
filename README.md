Simple pixel shader viewer
==========================

Build:
------
make

Usage:
------
./sdrviewer \<shader filename\>

NOTE: if you are editing files using Vim you need to do:
:set nowritebackup

otherwise vim will temporarily save the file and then mv the
tmp file to the old => we aren't watching the correct file
